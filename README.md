# certificates

This project is part of the evaluation of the course ‘Mobile Information Systems’ during the summer semester of 2021 at the Fachhochschule Aachen.

## Context

The certificates app is to be used by students from LUCA School of Arts and the persons responsible for the workplaces in the school.

In the workplaces students can use different machines while working on their projects. Typical machines are sawing machines, milling machines, electrical screwdrivers, 3D printers, laser cutters,…Certain equipment can be used without instruction, but other, more specialized, equipment may only be used when some training has been followed successfully.

To prove that a student has the required knowledge to use a certain machine of equipment, he/she receives a certificate. These certificates will be provided digitally only. The app will allow to check that the student has the certificate.

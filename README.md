## certificates


This project is part of the evaluation of the course ‘Mobile Information Systems’ during
the summer semester of 2021 at the [Fachhochschule Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/).

## Context

The certificates app is to be used by students from [LUCA School of Arts](https://www.luca-arts.be/en) and the persons 
responsible for the workplaces in the school.
<br>

In the workplaces students can use different machines while working on their projects. 
Typical machines are sawing machines, milling machines, electrical screwdrivers, 3D printers, 
laser cutters,…Certain equipment can be used without instruction, but other, more specialized, 
equipment may only be used when some training has been followed successfully.
<br>

To prove that a student has the required knowledge to use a certain machine of 
equipment, he/she receives a certificate. These certificates will be provided digitally only. The 
app will allow to check that the student has the certificate.

## Design and color theme decision
We wanted to offer the students an enviroment, that was familiar for them. Therefore we got inspired by the website of the LUCA School of Arts. 
By using the same recognizable font for headlines and color for buttons, this creates an enviroment that the students automatically have a connection to.
The green banner below the app bar is a signature that symbolizes our company.
